## 📖 About Us

Mi Primer Bitcoin – El Salvador was the first node of the network where everything began. Our mission is to provide independent, impartial, open-source Bitcoin education to the world. What began in El Salvador, is an example of showing what really is possible. We believe in distributing power, not concentrating it; that’s why we created the independent educators Node Network - a movement where individuals and communities from all over the world join in to create and share their knowledge and passion for Bitcoin education in their own community.
