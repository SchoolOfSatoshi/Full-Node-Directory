## 🏆 Recent Achievements
One of our most exciting recent achievements is the launch of Bitcoin Kiboozi: a street-interview series where we take Bitcoin conversations directly to the people. In Uganda, ‘kiboozi’ means a casual chat, and that’s exactly what we aim for: open, relatable discussions about Bitcoin, money, and the changes we see in our economy. Through these conversations, we’ve connected with everyday Ugandans, especially university students, listening to their stories, their challenges, and their hopes for the future. It’s our way of making Bitcoin education real, local, and human.
